31340,A Winter's Tale (Cosy Fireside Mix),"It's Winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming
Sea-gulls are flyin' over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky
Children are fantasising
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming

So quiet and peaceful
Tranquil and blissful
There's a kind of magic in the air
What a truly magnificent view
A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

A cosy fireside chat
A little this, a little that
Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
Gentle rain beatin' on my face
What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky
Mountains are zoomin' higher
Little girls scream an' cry
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming
It's bliss",Queen,Rock; Hard Rock; Progressivo,39.7,5

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
the prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutching, your chest-plate contemplate
You bought to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

[Redman]
Yo.. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high

""This rule is so underrated.."" -> B.I.G.
""Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin"" -> Meth
""Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.."" -> B.I.G.

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
from Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off ""Get Money"", ""Player's Anthem""
Don't forget, ""One More Chance"" and, my other hits, other shit
niggaz spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
in and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer

[Method Man]
Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
that's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;
bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
and three charges, I got to ""See-three-P.O.'s""
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin swords in the WAR
that's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, ""Unbelievable"" rhyme that reaches
and touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
to kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)

Impetrate, simplest wine

Mistaken, something that's chewing you down

We don't where it went but we lost it
And it may never come back again but I see wish it would
We don't know what it was but it sure was good

First time I laid eyes on you I saw it
Shining in your eyes was bright as day
And when I held you in my arms I felt it
Oh but like a fool I let it slip away

We don't know what it was but we had it...

First time that we kissed I could taste it
Sweet upon my lips like a song
The moment we made love I knew we found it
One day I woken up and it was gone

We don't know what it was but we had it...

If you had one more chance would you take it
And would you stand beside me from now on
The second time around could we make it
And would you be there with me hold it on

I wanna be like him, he had a dreadful life
I wanna learn to shoot, I want to use a knife
I like the smell of fear that makes you paralyzed
I am the boy next door who put that fear in your eyes

I hope you can leave all this for yourself
I'll be your slave and then dig your grave
While we're makin' love, I dream revolver

They say I'm crazy, falling apart
Do you like the way I murdered your heart
I'm smart and cagey, I come in the night
If you let me in, you'll give up your life

He like to roll in the mud, up to his chin
Now I open my head and let his voodoo in
I rode those sissy bars all the way to hell

There's nothing left to tell

I hope you didn't need all this for yourself

If you let him in, he'll murder your heart
Boom, boom, bang, bang screams in the dark
If you let him in, he'll murder your heart

He's someone else inside
His life's no longer his own
He's someone else inside
Creepin' up when you're alone
And now he stands inside
He wants to take you to hell
But for him it's heaven

63277,Take Your Carriage Clock And Shove It,"In the board room the quiet man takes a
Second to think what do
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak
And he hears his own voice

For years and years he's done nothing but bow down andput up with their demands
She sits like a viper and offers the clock
Without giving a damn
He takes it

""Honour forbids me but honour damned
You have whined till you got what you want
I did the work and when thingsd were going badly
You left us to rot""

He locked the door of the boardroom
And turned like the scene from the old country song
Towering over the table he's lost
He is drunk with it all

""You only
Come back to us when we'd turned it around
When we'd rescued your arse from fire
Your contribution to all that we did was to say
it was dire""

""Night after day after night I've been working
Despite of you fucking us all
Now I'm going to die I don't care if you cry
Just please leave me alone
And spare your tears for yourself
We've had those till were sick
You should leave while you still have the chance""

Yeah I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow
At a pace for the papes I thank y'all should know
I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin me
And plus I'm tryin to get my money on like Monopoly
Politickin economy, if I could be a made nigga
Smokin on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga
Keepin it real, I'm still deep in the field
Deep with the skills for the bills
I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill
I bring the thrill like Will Clark
I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth
You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth
I serve the thunder, that shit that'll brang in the roof

And every nigga gon' cry when he hit
The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
if they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line
Feelin like I'm runnin out of time
It's now or never, chasin this cheddar 'til things get better

Organize the brains and muscle

In this land of despair
Our banner in blood
We carry to war
With shields and spears
The killing fear

Legions - god of war
Legions - calling you
Legions - hades fall
Legions - march of doom

Confront them, destroy 'em
Smash them all
Their putrid carcass
Laying on the ground
Spartan warriors
Bravest of all
Their bodies piled up
Form a human wall

Legions - god of war

Legions - hades fall
Legions - march of doom

Bloody purge - total scourge
The gates of doom will open soon

Oh dementia you better treat me good

It's easy
I can scare with a stare

Hey Ringo, It's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall
When you're small

Whether dressed in disciplined style

When you're small
You walk as if you're falling

I attack from the back
Because it's easy
And I can assail
While wearing very nice jewellery

Oh hey Ringo, It's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall
When you're small

Whether dressed in disciplined style
Nevermind
When you're small
You spend your life crawling

I burst into public bars
And I throw my weight around
And no one can even see me
No one can even see me
Nobody can see me
No one can see me

Success is just a mess, Oh

Which steps into his life

He'll be crucified
Death awaits
Knocking at his door
Agony
Leave him

Too late to say goodbye
Too late

Deliverance at all
he's born to find this end
I am the one
The one who's calling
Obey my call to the cemetary
And don't be afraid
To step into the dark
Be sure that my voice
will take You home

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes You will obey
Time isn't here to stay

This can't be God's will
He surrendered long ago
There was no real chance

Ashes to ashes, you all will be dust again

Well, your pretty blue eyes they were drivin' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing is they were lookin' at me.

I held open the car door for you then you climbed inside and slid on over
To the other side...I thought my, oh my...

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the Cottonwood tree
Its a good thing and I'm wishin'
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window while the world's sleepin'
Cause you know I need you and there's no way I'll be leavin'
Til we're kissin' on the porch swing, oh my little sweet thing

Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's Mustang its his favorite car and so I can't stay long...

Standin' here feelin' like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little more time, is that such a crime?",Keith Urban,Country,0.4,0

I don't want to be selfish anymore,
I want so much to change,

There's still so much to know,

To the morgue... Take him to the morgue

At... Devil Lake... Sanitarium, many a patient had died in vain
Never a question to be asked, no no, never a thing to explain
So they took his bones and skin to the morgue in the West Wing
It was clear... to Dr. Eastmann
Harry had died of fright in the night
If he had cared he would have found the spider
Laying eggs in Harry's neck

The smoldering eyes... in Harry's head
Had become the home... of spiders instead

To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue
To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue

Deep down... below the ground
Where it was kind of cold and damp
Too many stiffs to be fit in the cooler
Gathering dust in the Hallways of Death

The smoldering eyes... in Harry's head
Had become the home... of spiders instead

Spiders here... Spiders everywhere
Spiders feeding the dead to their young
Spiders here... Spiders everywhere
Spiders using the dead for their home

Spiders... they're growing like rats from the plague
Spiders... there's so many more everyday

Summer ___ is coming to an end
And the cellar in the morgue is a nest now
One thousand poisonous creatures
Eight thousand poisonous legs

The smoldering eyes... in Harry's head
Had become the home... of spiders instead

Whether I'm up or down
I'm on the mend, transcending all reality
I like you, despise you, admire you
What are we gonna do when everything all falls through?
I must confess, I've made a mess
of what should be a small success
But I digress, at least I've tried my very best, I guess
This, that, the other, why even bother?
It won't be with me on my deathbed
but I'll still be in your head

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny

My internal monologue is saturated analog
It's scratched and drifting, I've become attached to the idea
It's all a shifting dream, bittersweet philosophy
I've got no idea how I even got here
I'm resentful, I'm having an existential time crisis
Want bliss
Daylight savings won't fix this mess
Under-worked and over-sexed
I must express my disinterest
The rats are back inside my head
what would freud have said?

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny

I wanna wash out my head with turpentine, cyanide
I decide this internal diatribe
When I try to catch you right, I hate seeing you cry
In the kitchen, I don't know why it affects me like this
When you're not even mine to consider
Erroneous, harmonious, I'm hardly sanctimonious
Dirty clothes, I suppose we all outgrow ourselves
I'm a fake, I'm a phony, I'm awake, I'm alone
I'm homely, I'm a scorpio

No time for dreams or goals

Her body she has sold so her child can eat

What is happening to this world we live in

In our home and other lands



Chorus:

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets

People can't find enough to eat

Now our kids can't go out and play

That's the state of the world today

His only friend, the doll he carries with him

Goes to school each and every day

To be teased because he has no place to stay

This young and homeless boy feels his life is

worthless

Instead of suicide he cries himself to sleep

And it's happenin' to this world we live in

There's got to be a better way

This ruin of bricks can go at any time to donw
I make hot, I make hot, do not stop

Kissing my summer-gun
Ending with the fanatics in Ramadan

Yea nigger get around to your girlfriend
The free G-Unit, who you'll blame
This is our game
Yea the southside will bang
New song, new rhymes
New figures from the crime
Jeep matte black, down the street
The bitch out of his car his weak
Putting your foot off the line kid
That is our base, has no where to hide
You can't cry, you should cry
Position of the star is our life
Our good life!

OK! I'm so tasty as a chocolate cream
I trained the dream tean
Into in my convertible with that jeans
I'm the winner, I'm your dream
50 Cent the rap king
Touching the sky, flying in my horse
I'll show my force
In my gray lead Porsche
In remembering the old days club
Turning the cap back and chewing bub
Leather shoes, Italian suits are 'shows'
Diamonds bracelets and platinum pistols
Bentleys in the door, photographers in the dark
Michael Jackson is wanted in my place, I'MA STAR!
Running into a car
Clothing Gala over the waistcoat of war
Doped to wiskhy, falling leg of the bitch
So I'm known as killer 50

80541,Just Smile,"I've been working so hard
We spent too long apart
And you've been thinking
Playing tricks on your mind
Made your words sound unkind
You were cold, oh so cold
I can see from your tears you think it's over
Got the whole weight of our love
On your shoulders

You know as well as I do
That our prospects are good
If you think I'm leaving
Then you've misunderstood

Just smile and I'll be yours again
Baby just sing a little word in my ear again
Don't worry 'bout the things that you said
Don't mean anything
One smile that's when I'll be yours again

When you told me to go
You lost all self control, I was hurting
Now you're filled with regret
Cos you can't take it back
Feel all alone,
When you should of known

You don't need to make it a drama now
Cos you should know the way that I'm feeling
No need to complicate things to work this out
Here's how... smile",Olly Murs,Pop,0.0,4

'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain;
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain.


The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home


I'm sick of the past I can't erase,
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace,
The mountains of things that I still regret,
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
(No matter where I go)

The fire I began, is burning me alive

But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go

Is it over yet? Will I ever love again?

77439,Have You Ever Been In Love?,"In the morning light
Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever laid there thinking
Was it all a dream?
But you reach out and she's there
Every moment, everywhere
Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever felt
How far a heart can fall
Have you ever stayed up waiting
For a telephone call
Just to hear her say hello
'Cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when she's far away
Have you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered
It just doesn't pay
'Cause with her, you can be true
And with her, you can be you
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

Do you dream you're still together
And wake up alone

(As recorded by Patsy Cline 2/13/58)

Last night I dreamed
Of you, sweetheart
Once more you loved me
You said we'd never part

It's dawn again
Oh, how sad am I
My dream has ended
And tears fill my eyes

Gently swaying around my feet
Like memories from the past
Each leaf reminds me of a dream
A dream that wouldn't last

For once I know
Your promise you would keep
If I could only
Only stay asleep

24777,Coney Island,"Coming down from Downpatrick
Stopping off at St. John's Point
Out all day birdwatching
And the craic was good
Stopped off at Strangford Lough
Early in the morning
Drove through Shrigley taking pictures
And on to Killyleagh
Stopped off for Sunday papers at the
Lecale District, just before Coney Island

On and on, over the hill to Ardglass
In the jamjar, autumn sunshine, magnificent
And all shining through

Stop off at Ardglass for a couple of jars of
Mussels and some potted herrings in case
We get famished before dinner

On and on, over the hill and the craic is good
Heading towards Coney Island

I look at the side of your face as the sunlight comes
Streaming through the window in the autumn sunshine
And all the time going to Coney Island I'm thinking,
Wouldn't it be great if it was like this all the time.

In the darkness left alone
Walls surround that hellish hole
deadly deep and no way out
from above I hear a swinging
metal blade clinging

In the pit and the pendulum
the pit and the pendulum
comin' near and nearer

In the inquisition's claw
sentence of death is their law
though unholy and sadistic
it's a question of their honour,
of gods to die for

With the pit and the pendulum
the pit and the pendulum
swingin' above my throat

The pit and the pendulum
could it be the soldiers â€˜re coming?
The pit and the pendulum

It flies from the other side of the world

'I'm tired' I said
'You always look tired' she said
'I'm admired' I said
'You always look tired' she said
Not 'til I can read by the moon
Am I going anywhere
Not 'til I can read by the moon

But everyone knows
You hear through the walls in this place
Cigarette holes for every lost soul
To give up the ghost in this place
Give me strength

Blackened affairs
And she could not breathe
Cuz she felt scared
Couldn't help but stare
Out of the window
Even though she wouldn't go outside

She wouldn't answer the door
Curtains were drawn
And the house was cold
Children were old
And they did not care
That's what she thought
But they tried to help
But she wouldn't answer the door

And the love we're hoping for is dying
Just like this city that we're all in

As time went on
She felt she belonged
In a trapped domain
Drove her insane
And the men she loved
Over the years
They would only use her
They would only use her

'Cause the love we're hoping for is dying
Just like this city that we're all in

Tonight they hunt for you

96744,You're My Heart,"[LL Cool J]
Do you remember, the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Bein able to say, from the bottom of your heart
[smooch] I love you for real
Your eyes, meet; you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
.. OOOOOOH what a thrill!
You was always searchin, and finally your dream came true
They came strollin along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear - I'll never do you wrong
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothin in the world could seperate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you -- you're my heart

You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
and walk away aggravated and furious
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturin, and hey..
you can fight your own battles and wars
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissin caressin and huggin
and keepin each other warm
But now comes the serious part, cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
and you'd have to ask -- am I still your heart?

Am I still your HEART or is somethin, pullin us apart
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you - you shout out, so what?
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain
to me, the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?
Cause if it is, aww, baby, please.. don't do this to me
I'm tryin to reach you, tryin to talk to you
It's killin me -- cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it

You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees, and pray to God
that our love is in the cards
Cause I know you're right for me
And I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on
.. but see they don't understand
You're nothin to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
to stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife
We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard -- if I was still your heart

So make up your mind, cause I've made up my mind
I'm beggin you baby please come back home
I'll be tossin and turnin, as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones
This can't be true, I'm losin you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world.. is hold you tight
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand
and lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you.. I'ma call you in a little while
You're my heart

103356,Adventurer,"You're an adventurer
you sail across the oceans
you climb the Himalayas
seeking truth and beauty as a natural state

You're a queen reborn
worshipped from above afar
some see you as an elixir
an elemental natural seeking perfect grace

In a catacomb
or cave of endless drawings
prehistoric or religious
your accomplishments prodigious
seeking out the perfect tone

Your language so clear
your voice perfectly turning
as in the city I sit yearning
blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars
or driving fast in foreign cars
to capture your remains, huh

You're an adventurer
a turban wet wrapped 'round your head
on the mountainside they predict your death
oh how you fooled them all

But subjects are a poor excuse
when what you really want's a muse
an inspirating knowledge
of what comes before

Ooohhh, speeds of light
the momentary flicker
of a candle in its wicker basket
smoking wax, facts

Did you find that superior knowledge
that eluded you in college
Did you find that super vortex
that could cause your cerebral cortex
ooohhh, to lose its grip

You're an adventurer
you were out looking for meaning
while the rest of us were steaming
in an inspirating
ah, urban pit

An adventurer
you enter as I'm dreaming
I wish I'd never wake up
Differentiating scheming from my one true love

You're an adventurer
you love the angles and the cherries
the height and width of levies
the natural bridge and tunnels of the human race

You're an adventurer
nothing seem to scare you
and if it does it won't dissuade you
you just will not think about it
you dismiss it and defocus
you redefine the locus of your time in space, race

As you move further from me
and though I understand the thinking
and have often done the same thing
I find parts of me gone

You're an adventurer
and though I'll surely miss you
and of course I'll survive without you
and maybe good will come of that

But at this point, ah
I anticipate some grieving
and although I know your leaving
is a necessary adjunct to what we both do

An adventurer
splitting up the atom
splitting up the once was
splitting up the essence of our star-crossed fate

None who meet you
do forget you, my adventurer
my adventurer, my adventurer-venturer

42612,Forgotten Cult of Aldaron,"(Music by Nergal, lyrics by Nergal)

Since a long time Iâ€™ve visited those old dungeons
I spilled the first blood in the depth
In the darkness of the forestâ€™s maze
I found her, morbid beauty
I used to spend whole days
In the mystic places of Delduwath
There, where the light of the fullmoon
Fell as the dying sun
The wolfâ€™s howling was lulling to sleep
My young soul...

How beautiful were the views of nocturnal land
How wonderful was the life in complete solitude
Away from villages and towns, mentions and palaces
The last moments give birth to memories in me

Who was that beauty, majestic and great
What were those views, beautiful gilded by leaves
Which were hiding behind them so many mystic wefts
They stole my solitude and independence
I lie crushed by the chains in a wet cell, bleeding
I am waiting for mother, the last hope, death
Let the died out fire awake in me, let it awake Aldaron

Black gusts of dust covered my divine person with their arms
The gates of nature for ages dead, opened themselves
tears of soil filled green valley
Naked Carpathian mountains denuded its might
Rights which created this world
With fury strike heaven, pearly gates
The dark powers of nature unleashed veritable war
The last breaths of sun falling onto the snow

40439,Gravenimage,"We met that night, when the sea ran high.
And I craved for more of that nearlove experience.
Those who the music hath then joined together, are now put asunder....

Remember me, when I lit the fire.
To keep us warm.
On a cold winter morning. Now I pass through the moment.
Can I still recognize a beautiful melody...

I play a note, but hear no sound. Have I lost my love or the wings I found.
When I was young,,,
...and eager to please anyone who had time...

Needed to sing, the very notes I heard.
Had to stay in the shadows and seek for the loneliness.
Nevertheless, the price was higher than I realized.
I was to live alone, ready to make the sacrifice.
Was I in love with you...

My old heart, little harder again. One the light goes out, everything ends.
It is time...ready to cause a scene, ready to make the sacrifice.
Ready to play the note, ready to end the final show.
The only thing I know.

The pain is here. To stay I fear. In my eyes. I can change one note and make you cry.
In this state of mind. Silence is a crime.

How can life be so feigned and cold. I've answered the call of every melody, lovingly.
Did I find the answers to all my questions.

Or a gravenimage of me...

If I found the hidden fountain. Drank the wisdom from it's deep.
Would I have the time to save me. Would I have them both to keep.",Sonata Arctica,Heavy Metal; Rock; Hard Rock,0.0,1

Gotta move ahead
There's nothing left
To be done or said
She's gone to work
And left a note on the door
Just goodbye
It couldn't say more

Forget your job
And we'll stay in bed
Nothing's left
But you in my head
So drive this car
And we'll run away
Nothing left
But a perfect day

But I don't understand it
I thought I always would
And I know that I need it
It always felt so good

No matter what
I'll never let you go
No matter what
I'll never let you go

Don't wanna stay here
I can't get away
There's nothing left

So I'll stay here
With an open door
I miss your taste
But I need you more

Cause I don't understand it
I thought I always would
And I know that I need it
You always taste so good

Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray, so bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin good, I was too proud
And STILL you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin it back
That's somethin new to me, so I'm askin you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I DO!
I guess what I'm askin is - show me how to stand for you
And I will RAP for you, SING for you, PREACH for you, TEACH for you
REACH for you - I will love you like you love me, unconditionally
And I will ALWAYS be prepared, for whatever the mission'll be
GIVE THE NUTRITION TO ME, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, BEFORE I GO, let me give
Thanks to you Lord, my birth, for every day that I've lived
You gave me a love most of my life I didn't know was there
IN THE NAME OF JESUS! I give you my life, cause you care

To keep me from going astray
And a honky tonk angel, to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away

I can laugh at your jokes
I can watch you fall down on your knees
I can close down this bar
Oh and gas up my car
And I can pack up and mail in my keys

That there's a way to right the wrong
And Lord while you're listening
Could I mention some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

Brings his daddy's gun to school
A little girl in New York City
Buys cocaine for Mama to use

(chorus)

My wife is crying; Our baby's fighting
A battle that she may not win
The doctor's doing all that he can
God now it's all in your hands

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong


Now I'm just one man, a grain of sand
In a troubled world I know
But I've got a problem right here at home
I've got a problem right here at home

but I'm still not even close to where I'm going
(and now) I can no longer see the shine
that has been lighting up my way
I cannot feel its glowing

The fire in my heart is dying
and the zeal I had is gone

This path that I've chosen's a rocky one
Long, hard and frozen it has become
Each turn that I've taken on the way
has only led me back to Hell
I am dying down growing weaker now
It could seem that I'm doing fine
but I'm broken to little pieces deep inside

Why did I ever choose to go this way
The question I keep asking myself all the time
I guess it was my instinct for self-destruction
that pointed me down this way

The fire in my eyes is dying
and the dream I had is gone

This path that I've chosen's a rocky one

Might have brought it on himself

But alls not lost in this tangle like no other

That he still remembers

Giving into the love
You know it's right

Sailing into the dreams of what could be
Reaching out for some form of contact
Waiting for the one you know is right

Moving forward down the right track

The bluebird of faith sails far off to the shore
She sleeps on the breeze of the coming of love
For the homelands of Ireland

So many times on the clouds of forgiveness
We walk through the country and feel so at ease
A gentle reminder how things really are
In the homelands of love

So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs
And the freedom of love

Armed to go
Sights lock on
Targets below
Objects marked
Cue bomb bay
Pull the trigger
Bombs away
Say your last goodbyes
We're coming to your skies
A reckoning this day
You threatened our shores
So now we'll come to yours
And make you all pay

Chorus:
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

Shells explode
Flashing light
Burning fires
Turn day to night
Head on back
Reload bay
Armed again
Bombs away
You don't stand a chance
Air Force has advanced
To blow you all away
Soon you'll understand
That we will burn your land
On this judgement day

Much is gone
Fight's not done
Third wave
Has just begun
One to go
Mustn't stall
Do it now
Fuck ‘em all
Nothing you can do
We're coming after you
Today is the day
Pay for what you've done
We'll bomb you one by one
Until you all have paid

14874,Too Dumb For New York,"Verse 1:
D
When i first saw New York city

I was green down to the core

You could see my red neck glowing

For a mile or maybe more
A
Between the hustlers and the hookers

I must have made their day

Cause they peeled me like an apple,Lawd
D
And sent me on my way


Bridge 1:

When you're pushed and shoved and almost mugged

It ain't no place to be

So i came to one conclusion
A
New York ain't for me


Chorus:
D
From sea to shining sea

And coast to coast

Somewhere in the middle

Is the land i love the most
A
I ain't California pretty

I can't survive the Great White Way

I'm too dumb for New York city
D
And too ugly for L.A.


Verse 2:

I made my way to Tinseltown

To Hollywood and Vine

Out among those pretty faces

I'd surely find a place for mine
A
The way i walk-the way i talk

They'll hang on every word

But don't call me,i'll call you
D
Was all i ever heard


Bridge 2:

In L.A. what they're thinking

Ain't what they talk about

At least in New York city
A
There's never any doubt


Chorus.

A
I'm too dumb for New York city
D
And too ugly for L.A.

The incinerator towers are breathing out into the cold
The birdes are making spirals high above the neon skyline
Across the drifting swirl of charcoal and gold
Islands in silver seas as the land falls into shadow
These are more real for me than all that I left behind
And if I could only choose one moment to last forever
I would be here with you
Between dog and wolf
Between water and wine
Between wine and blood

From the black and icy river's edge to the ressurrection garden
We were in the arms of something that was unfolding
I close my eyes and see wild horses coming from the sky
Narcotic dreams and miracles descending
Silence my silver tongue and meet me somewhere deeper
Everything's how it feels - is what you were trying to say
And if I could only choose one moment to last forever
I would be here with you in the place between dog and wolf

Where the breath is deeper and the lights are diamond
Where the blood runs faster and the taste is stronger

She lay down beside him
to touch him and guide him,
turn 'round his head
on the darkest of days.

He still sits beside her,
remembers her smiling
and whisper to him
that old song he would play.

Please lay down beside me,

And when you swerving it excites me
The way you just doing in, Nike
Almost like here's two of me, Siamese
My main thing fuck me good like a side piece
Tell me that I'm beautiful and get it from the side please
And I'll be calling out your name like you need to be reminded
This pussy yours baby, this pussy yours baby
So add some to your food and have more baby
Cause you got me on lock, like a close door
Now hurry up cause you know what I'm waiting for

You're all that I need in the world

When I met you I was all alone
Cold and lonely cryin' on the phone
You baked me brownies and said ""don't you cry""
And gave me the coat off your back

When I call you put them all on hold
And say to me that you'd do anything
and all I can do is say that
I haven't much I can give you in return
Only my heart and a promise not to turn
But I'll sing to you every day and every night
Susanne, I'm your man

Why so worried?

Come back to bed boy

This effigy of flesh, corporeal christi, nailed
In submission to this false idol, seeking deliverance
From this spiritual hierarchy, downward spiralling, a corrupt throne
Of repression and guilt

Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn

On my knees, before this tormented flesh, in irreverence
In communion with this parasitic host of virtuous divinity
This imperious creed bears testament to the failures of our morality
Righteous durance is our cross we bear in stations
In stations of the lost

Our will be done
Thy kingdom burn - thy kingdom burn
Our will be done

From your knees arise
By your own hand, your god you scribe
The earth shall inherit the meek
Your god is dead

Bound down, in God we're trussed, foul stature
Icons embodied in flesh, we nail
In servitude to deities fashioned in our self image
Shadows of eternal strife cast by those who serve

Tryin to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood

Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing round like little boys do

And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldnt believe what I heard him say

Sir, I wanna buy these shoes
For my mama, please
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir?
Daddy says theres not much time
You see, shes been sick for quite a while
And I, know these shoes will make her smile
And I, want her to look beautiful
If mama meets Jesus tonight

And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.
He searched his pockets franticly
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house
Most years she just did without
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do
Somehow Ive gotta buy her these Christmas shoes

So I laid the money down
I just had to help him out
And Ill never forget the look on his face
when he said Mamas gonna look so great

Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ringer
I couldn't give a {{fuck}}, how could I give her finger?
Let alone have bad for closets
So claustrophobic, if there are close objects
Now it's sort of like two car garages
It's like two broad menages, you're the best, mama

Is there any chance that you remember, mami being more?
Just a horrible man, and would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second
shot at romance? Aw baby, I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't till now I see how much i missed you
Girl I'm sorry I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once it dawns the truth
I can be fake, I can be phony

You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had

Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, the same outcome as Chilli, girl, I let 'em all go
Oooh, no more trickin and kissin miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you; how much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool

I can be fake, I can be phony

On one side the government, the other the mob
Hey, hey ain't that right

Oh, this country sure looks good to me
But these fences are comin' apart at every nail.

Way up on the old dew line
Some of the boys were feelin' fine
A big light flashed across the sky
But somethin' else went slippin' by
Meanwhile at the Pentagon
The brass was a wonderin' what went wrong.

So sad her eyes as it began
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did sway
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Heeding unheard pleading one word
So sad my eyes she cannot see

How did thee fare what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

The sky is full of momentary light
And everything we need is just too far
We are photons released from a dying star
We are fireflies a child has trapped in a jar
And everything is distant as the stars
I am here and you are where you are

We have lived a long time here in the forest
We lie beneath the heaps of leaves
We are partial to this partial light
We cannot sleep and fear our dreams
There is no order here, nothing can be planned
We are fireflies trapped in a little boy's hand
And everything is distant as the stars
I am here and you are where you are

And we lie among our atoms and I speak to you of things
And hope sometimes that maybe you will understand
There is no order here and there is no middle ground
Nothing can be predicted and nothing can be planned

Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

[Hook]

It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game
Baby here I go again

[Chorus]

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby here I go again

Here I Go Again

[Verse 2]

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just cant excape the memories
I tried but I just cant break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

[Hook]

58263,Start Over,"Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words
I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

[Chorus]
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you
I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

[Chorus]
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again

28090,Beyond Me,"Where does your allegiance lie?
In failing hearts and idle hands
What corrupted eyes
To heed the certainty of man
You fail me
I never was my final word
I could never be
The only voice I heard

Trust in the powerless
The ever knowing inside
See no deliverance
Leave all conviction behind
The darkest of hearts they cease to bleed

(And) never deny for the self to lead
You'll find in this a lonely home
No tear consoled
To wander on a nameless road
Beyond me

Compromise all time unseen
For this, your momentary lust
Pride deafening
Unsung hymns gather rust
No corruption, delusion, enslavement here
Driven not by fear
Not converted to

I see an aimless soul
In the ruthless cold
Fighting off the call
Dying to be whole
I see an aimless soul
In the ruthless cold
Fighting off the call
Giving in to the fall

You'll find in this a lonely home
No tear consoled
To wander on a nameless road

43418,Mirror Of Me,"I never thought I feel a whim
slipping through my hands
the morning light comes breaking in
as the blacknessfades

No bad reflections can resist
the beginning of an age
a sentence for a crownless king
whose kingdom was a cage

Wonder again why
why should we miss the burning of the flame
wait for another sign of rising disorder
till the blade relieves the pain

Refrão:
Inside your eyes I see a mirror
you mesmerize and there's no error
myself in you to be continued
Inside your eyes I see a mirror of me!

I kept a token of my pleas
carved them into stone
but after sailing open seas
two became one

Wonder again why
why should we cease the spreading of the stain
wait for another sign of rising disorder
till the light 'cause again

Refrão:
Inside your eyes I see a mirror...

Just a figure in a big Monopoly game
Struggle is the price you pay
You get just enough just to give it away
You're sinking more than floating away
Just throw me a line so I can anchor my pain
The fabric is about to fray
The fabric is about to fray

Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Things keep coming and I keep wondering
I start feeling the walls close in
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break

I've been running through my mind today
Scenario has to catch your hypocrisy
No one ever takes the blame
But everyone is searching for a cure to the pain
Nothing ever seems to change
Oh, nothing ever seems to change
We just play broken records in a deaf man's charade

Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately

And I start feeling the walls close in
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break

Carry on just a pawn and the same old song
I'm still holding on
The fabric is about to fray

Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately
Things keep coming and I keep wondering
And I start feeling the walls close in

Why can't it be wrong

Could've left home at a quarter to nine
Could've had fun in plenty of time

Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong

Moral preached by ! <Imoral>!immortal fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tare me up inside

Your son die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
The way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed

My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame

So throw your stone of guilt at me
Point your finger, curse my name
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame

Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will brake
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tare your souls appart

So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe

The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tare your souls appart

The mad man Malik makes MCs run for Milk of Magnesia
Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin, master as in great
I'll have your brain goin in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so your stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks
While you playin hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
Cuz I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin around with wack rhymin
You lose your grip from chalk climbin
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, cuz all MCs are gettin served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
Cuz rappin ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin any beef
Ain't nuthin sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin street
Phife Dawg, swingin it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus cuz I'm losin my breath

Now, when I'm with some cheese, I be lettin off gism
Writin rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I gotta brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin through your projects in your birthday suit
Cuz your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If youse a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, everday all day, similar to water
Crushin MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin good stuff in my ear, runnin fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations

75867,Into The Sun,"It's been a while since you last saw me
One breaks down and the other ones fade
These eyes can see the days break
Too late for the other's mistakes

Sit down laugh thinking what have we done
Let me inside
Is it all over before it's begun
Please give me some time

Cause we are running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun

I never meant to let you go
Why did I leave maybe we'll never know
But I'm a man now broken on the ground
I'm in need and I think that it shows

All this time we're going nowhere and we know it
I was so blind
All the lights are leading to where you're going
I'm not far behind

and now we're running into the sun

47022,To Be Dead,"Destroy the corpse and release my mind
The secrets contemplate the other side
It won't be long until the death of me
A spirit conscious of reality

To be dead is to always be
Close my eyes and retun to sand
To be dead is to always dream
Coherent thought but unseen by man

Invisible to human sight
The consequences in his afterlife
Across the line from the ignorant
Inside my mind I do not know sin

To be dead is to always be
Open-eyed in a sleeping mind
To be dead is to always dream
I'm prepared for my turn to die

Inflicting sorrow on the enemy
And to everyone who doubted me
My constant presence will torment the soul
As I stand watching in the other world

To be dead is to always be
Untied from the living flesh
To be dead is to always dream
Unforgiven when I meet with death

in the shadow of the mountain as the cattle hung their heads
grazing only feet from where the broken body lay
and would lay undiscovered for another several days
when the farmer would find vultures at their banquet in the hay
the killer traveled eastbound in a golden brown sedan
weighing his most recent deviation from the plan
counting down the hours til the sun came up again
hired to hit the farmer by the farmer's asshole son

24154,Shots,"Shots
Ringing all along the borders can be heard
Striking out like a venom in the sky
Cutting through the air faster than a bird
In the night.

Children
Are lost in the sand, building roads with little hands
Trying to join their father's castles together again
Will they make it? Who knows where or when
Old wounds will mend?

Machines
Are winding their way along, looking strong
Building roads and bringing back loads and loads
Of building materials
In the night

Men
Are trying to move the borders on the ground
Lines between the different spots that each has found
But back home another scene was going down
In the night.

Lust
Comes creepin' through the night to feed on hearts
Of suburban wives who learned to pretend
When they met their dream's end
In the night.

Shots
I hear shots, I keep hearing shots
I keep hearing shots
I hear shots.

Shots
I hear shots, I keep hearing shots
I keep hearing shots
I hear shots.

But I'll never use your love,
You know I'm not that kind
And so if you give your heart away
I promise to you
Whatever we do
That I will always be true.

Did you do it good
Did you do it right
Did you get that pain
Crawling up your spine
Did you feel the heat
Of my sugar ray
Swear I saw that light
Shining on your face
All my friends have fun with guns
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want

Did you read my poem
Did you get my poem
Did it break your bones
Almost broke my bones
Did you feel my lips
Did they slide and slip
Did you feel my head
Shaking through your wrist

Sugar through your ray
All those boys have fun with sores
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want
Is you

Darling you're so good
Oh if felt so good
Did you feel that heat
Did you feel the heat

Walking dead we are
Victims of misfortune and lies, and tortured bringers of demise
Circling above like vultures

They reap the harvest that we sew and take, like trusting fools
Promising charade
All days now disappear from weeks to months, from months to years
Forever bound, shackled to the wall

The night falls, I've seen 1000 moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Sacred and serpentine, a hypnotizing twisted theme
Weaves our souls to roar
Like candles in the wind, our echoed cries above the din
Fade into this faceless sculpture

In the wheel of chance and fate, spinning as we watch and wait
A mystery to us all
On the edge of sanity, we tread the seas of destiny
Forever bound, silent voices call

The night falls, I've seen 1000 moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise

Shape of you, shape of you
Shape of you

No reason to pretend different
It's just that I'm still dreaming
And my dreams all have you
The shape of you

Yeah, I'm older now, but I'm still dreaming
The sky is what I believe in
Stars scatter in the shape of you

Yeah, you're in my Milky Way
That's really all that I can say
When I think of the shape of you

Shape of you, shape of you
Shape of you

Please come over
Don't come over
Please come over
Here
Welcome the last day of our lives

I will break the circle
Walls, I'll tear them down
And guilt will break the silence
But there is no return
No returna
We shall overcome

We will bring you back
To a moment in time
We will reveal and detect
What you are
Precious truth in a cage
It has been captured but safe
And there we'll bind it and
Blind it with lies

The king will come
World will come undone

He is the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

Now, as we speak
There's a way
There's a door
Come find us
And join us
Come see it and feel it

Doors in and out
You shall be falling
Your mind's still trapped in twilight
Now, catch a glimpse
Shall I get through
They've walked on
To the other side
But how could I know?
I'm drowning
Drowning
Where do I belong?
Drown in shadows

Don't blame me
It's my lying toad

They've moved
Further into the unknown

Mark my words
They will be gone
You'll see them playing games, my dear
They've moved along
Cause one day in the afterlife
We'll meet again
They've frowning
Frowning
On your judgement day
They are shadows
They're in the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all

Shadows will be rising soon

There's a fed door

And I feel summertime passing in haste, like running out of patience

Quilted with knit and umbrellas and scarfs and a mild understanding of irony
I feel autumn leaving the race, all done with the exhilaration

9 units of demons, The Ancient Ones will stand

600 were watching in horror as they began to fight
None of the armies were using a weapon
As it is known to man
Demons and Angels were falling in numbers
Out of the burning sky... The burning sky
""Retreat, retreat"", Oh the angels flee, ""Defeat, defeat""
The battle's over, it's done

Somewhere in ancient Spain, close to what was BAECULA
There lay the battleground where many an angel was slain

Solo: S

9 units of demons bringing unbearable sin
9 units of demons coming for the people within
The ""House Of The Dead"" will soon live up to its name
600 people running deep inside
600 people trying to hide
From the Ancient Ones
But there's nowhere to run on this day

Solo: D

There is no need to speak of the horrible fate
Bestowed upon the 600 from BAECULA

Some say they don't

And I can never get enough

Then she smiled at me and gave me
The shirt right off her back

or you can lose your soul,

Endless speculation, why would I repent?
If I find salvation and the book of hymns
Their annihilation will not get me in
Expose god religion to my dying death
Cannot be forgiven by your holiness
Will I learn my lesson, bare their sympathy?
Answer to your question - that ain't happening

Bow before no god that cannot be seen
And wants to show mercy on people like me
Facing their judgment to settle the score
Refusal of penance, I laugh at your lord

Grace of god refusal, evil to the end
Instrument of Satan, I have always been
Challenge my conviction to the Baphomet
Smash his crucifixion right against your head
Contents under pressure explode, kill your ass
Total devastation in the aftermath
I behold no penance, only dignity
In hell with Lord Satan for eternity

Umm hey, comin from Where I'm From (I'm from) ohhh yea

[Ja Rule]
Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over the car limos
While they mom was at home, tears hittin the pillow
Where women in the middle in a serminal funereal
Shed a tear cause he lost his son the same way a year ago
It's the same egospiritual, we thuggin in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty
Why them niggaz in the hood never hit the lottery
Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family
Ya'll call it a tragedy, Damn
How I could just kill a man
His blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
If you hearing me speak please Lord give me a chance
Please forgive me of my sins, cause we cleansed where I'm from

[Chorus] - [Lloyd]
Me and my niggaz ride
Even when the sun don't shine and its cold outside
I never run in or hide, cause some niggaz hate it
But I can't get faded cause I done made it
Instead of struggling or strive
Survive my weight how these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from Where I'm From (I'm from)
We all walk back in line (yeah)

[Ja Rule]
Now everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us
Can I get a moment of SILENCE
Cause they claimin it's the niggaz that's causin all the violence
What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin the blue colla', with shots soon to follow
The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power
But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island
He was only 13, but tried us in the dope and as high as the coast
Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from

We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin
Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish
Pushin hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin weed with my niggaz
On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitchs
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every
other weekend
If I don't have to kill niggaz, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my niggaz that we
lost in the ghetto
Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and nike's
Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
But in New Yitti niggaz follow they dreams, where I'm from

At least you know what I think
I know that I’m lucky I know you’re on the brink
You got it good good good you got it good so good
You make up ridiculous words
Which mean exactly nothing
I know just what you mean and that’s the funny thing
It’s understood it’s understood

Buddy buddy buddy I know why you wander
Through the sweetness on the ground
The sweetness of the flowers
You make your way on a cloudy day
You’ve got to move
The world you prove is too sweet yeah

We parted much too soon I know but that’s how it goes
There’s someone better out there for you and me
Can’t wait to get on the road and feel the shows
And be like phenomenon 1 and 2 and 3
I don’t mean to brag and I don’t mean to boast
But I’m the guy could that give you the most
It’s good good good it’s understood

76022,Son Of A Preacher Man,"Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talking
Cousin Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my suprise

Chorus:
The only boy who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I tried
When he started sweet talking to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight

Chorus

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each others knowing
Looking to see how much we'd grown

The only boy who could ever move me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever groom me
Was the son of a preacher man
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was

In my life there's places I've seen,
Places I've been in my life.
In my life there's things I have done,
Times I have won in my life.

Ships I have known,
Winds that have blown.

In my time were people who cared,
People who shared in my time,
Welcomed the good accepted the bad,
Enjoyed what I had in my time.

People I've known
Times on my own

And now I'm growing old,
In memory I can hold
My picture book unfolds and I
Can feel myself grow cold.

In my life there's times to forget,
Things to regret in my life,
May have done wrong but tried to do right
I followed the light in my life,
But now the lights grow dim,

He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'
The bravery of a man's mind is slavery
Is makin me the man I was made to be
I hate to see when cats know but don't spit it
Right is wrong, when it's on you gon get it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I wake up frustrated dog, I'm hurtin' inside
Think about the brothers that put in, work and then died
A certain have tried, a certain have cried
When it didn't go right, you hit me like
You see things ain't always what they seem to be
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me
And the reason I get through things so easily
Is by the grace of God cause he, see's the need to guide me
Walk right beside me
Because he knows what's goin on inside me, he tried me
Knew where my heart was at
Knew what I was thinkin
Knew when I was down and out, left there mistaken
Knew when to pick me up, cause it got too hard
Knew when I was gonna scream out ""Please God!""
And you already knew that you would be there for me
That's why I bring you together to give you the glory

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everyday of life is a new chapter
And it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture
The essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man, is not measured by what he does for himself but
What he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for reward or gold
What you give, you shall receive tenfold

And I, put that on my soul
And, put that on my life
And, everything I own
And, everything I know
And, everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everwhere I been, I was for a reason
Walk through the desert, ended up freezin
Start there, end up where?
And now they know...whatever which way they go

[Chorus]
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go
They know they gonna owe
They soul to the road they choose
It don't matter if you win or loose
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues

I am not your mate
I did not come to kick it

With the clouds to my West

Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter

Well you climb in my window
And you painted it gold
It was stone recognition
It was truth being told

And we burn down the Winter
With the fire we possess
And I wish you could know this
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter

Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter

Will not leave me alone

I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans
jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I don?t look like a millionnaire,
But I feel like a million bucks,
Ladies won't ya fill your cups,
Shady?s come to fill ya up,
If your a D or a C cup
You can even be a B
It's just me and Dre
You?ll be in the Er we?ll be strapped with so much
Tnt,
We may blow no not even Cpr from the Emt
Could help you to resuscitate
You busters must be flustered wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem Can?t you bust a grape,
What's my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
It's really not even fair to them,
Cos they pale in comparisons
So much they might as well wear a skin,
Don't you just wish you could share his pen
Cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
The fog is stinking the air is thin,
Cos he won't even let them try to breathe,
Da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
Girl you just hit the lottery,

[Chorus]
Now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
And hell breaks loose,
Try to restrain us you can't contain us,
We still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
So this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose,

[Dr Dre]
This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
Like it just splattered on stan
This is the only moment that matters,
Ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
Like chaos erupts Em?s in back Dre?s in the front
So do what we say at once this songs like a Seance, it haunts,

[Eminem]
It makes em stay in a trance
No choice they have to dance,

[Dr Dre]
It's like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what man you better lay off the
blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
Now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the
rust,
Shake all them cobwebs loose,
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
Yeah girl shake that caboose
I don?t wanna see you try to make no excuse,
Dre is on the loose,
A Mongoose when it's comes to the chronic use,
You know I can?t stand to lose,
Me and my goons are like animals,
We come through like a pack of wolves,
So we came here to retract the roof,
Yeah man ain't that the truth,
Girl your man?s like in the booth
Definitely back up in this b-tch,
This is when all hell breaks loose,

Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage I'm finna blow
As soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
I?m sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
We?re in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,

Yeah so let us in ?fore we huff and puff and we blow,
We ain't bluffin for nothing
We?ll knock the stuffing out ya
Revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
Yeah move or lose it three,
Move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
Pass some of that (?) lil right there,
That would be pretty stupid to me,
Born and raised in the Cpt,
Yeah Los Angeles who?s in the streets,

Keep that deuce deuce in the seat,

I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love
Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
I'm starry eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought the cards were a frame-up
I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
All things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now

Here I slip again
About to take that trip again
Got my grip again
Taking a chance on love
Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
In the groove again

In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot good-bye

12947,Papa Loved Mama,"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Mama was a looker
Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen

Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I h heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town

Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears

Mama was a looker
Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama
Mama loved men

Shot it in the air, one woke him

His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit

I told you don't ever ever come around here no more

I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me
But I was like ""Nah"", Chromes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun
Yeah I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
*** my eyes just scower the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a 2 hotel town?
Come on now, I peep your Lexus at you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accents ***
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?

And all the walls fall down
And all the fish get drowned

Just like the taste is pain

As she's singing in herself
And she walk right up to you
As she walk all over you

I'm happy in my box

And the sun don't shine
And all the stars don't shine

Thought I was lookin' good
So I cycled 'cross the neighbourhood
Was invited by a skinny girl
Into her high class world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

(Chorus)
I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here
I'll have me a real good time

(Repeat)

Dancing madly round the room, yeah
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune
Was escorted by a friendly slag
'Round the bedroom and back
Wandered across to the door
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead.

(Chorus)

The skinny girl made it clear
That she only came here for the beer
The vicar simply reeked of gin
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle

why didn't your call,
why didn't you write.
was it cause of him or was it just
cause you don't love me anymore.
you could have found some way to contact me.

But I know it's not my fault
Once hes gone I know you'll start to come around
I know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner,
I wouldn't have had to live my life this way.

Now that he's gone will I get to see you again
At least hear your voice again
I think its gonna workout this time around
We can be a family again not like before is gonna e different,
Were gonna do lots of stuff together
I think its gonna work out this time around not like before.

An old man stands on the hill,
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are a blaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly, touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I'll fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream,
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.

There's nothing more for me to say
I spoke my piece I'll go on my way
And fare thee well where'er you go
You might need help but I won't know
Cuz I'm up in here in my own cell
It could be heaven it could be hell
We'll never know just who we are
Cuz when we die we become a star
And stars can't talk because they have
No mouth to speak about their past
They simply shine up in the sky
And give their light to you and I
And where would we be without their light
We'd call out names and then start a fight
But then again that's what we do
I hate me and I hate you too
Cuz I'm in pain just like the spider
In the drain, I am a fighter
But I can't win I've got to lose

Reaching higher ground

I'd love to take my time
I'd let myself unwind
Cause sometimes it feels
These wheels keep spinning at the speed of sound

I'd take the scenic route
Ain't that what life's about
I would stop and smell
Each and every single rose I found

I'm so tired of saying someday that we'll do it
Grab the keys get in the car and let's get to it

Let's head north or east or west or south
Just as long as we go now
Let's let these headlights slice the night away
Till the sun comes out
If all the fun's in getting there
Then baby I have got a plan
Let's hit the road
C'mon let's go
Let's take the longest way we can

My heart's restless but it's true
When it comes to loving you
And that ain't never gonna change
No matter where we are

This old world keeps laughing like it's got us
Don't know why we ever let it stop us

24105,Peaceful Valley Boulevard,"One day shots rang across the peaceful valley
God was crying tears that fell like rain
Before the railroad came from Kansas City
And the bullets hit the bison from the train
Shots rang across the peaceful valley
White man laid his foot upon the plain.

The wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon
The settlers full of wonder as they crossed
A gentle creek where two old oaks were standing
Before the west was won there was a cost
A rain of fire came down upon the wagons
A mother screamed and every soul was lost.

Change hit the country like a thunderstorm
Ancient rivers soon began to boil
People rushed like water to California
At first they came for gold and then for oil
Fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes
Mother earth took poison in her soil.

An electro cruiser coasted towards the exit
And turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard
""People make the difference"" read a billboard
Above a long line of idling cars.

Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead this world
Who'll be the beacon in the night
Who'll be the one to lead the nations
And protect God's creations

A polar bear was drifting on an ice floe

And came away with nothing to decide

Far, far away a long, long time ago
From the dawn of time, a king shall rise

[II. The riders of Tulsha doom]

Black, on the snowy horizon
hundreds of stallions are riding
Sun beams breaking trough the clouds are shining
on the swords of their riders
They bear a standard of the blackest steel
with two snakes facing each other
The symbol of a new born religion,
rising to crush all the others

Riding like the cold winter wind
Killing and wading through gore
Their mission, by the name of their lord
is the search for the purest steel
Spilling sacred life's blood
and quenching a power mad thirst for the mightiest
of might, They ride!

but aboy with hate in his eyes
This boy will grow stronger and stronger each day
to be ready to fight
A man who someday will be a great king
by his own hand and will for revenge
To crush the riders who brought the snakes
on that day when snow became red

He'll be riding like the cold winter wind

Spilling evil life's blood

and we all have survived
but after all
still we fear
the hand of fate... tonight

Men on the mountain
from hell you came to destroy
the realm of our freedom
endangered to fade in the void

Now they are back on the earth
taking their wrath to our land
an ocean full of darkness awaits

we will resist, fight until the end

And down belou the dark lord awaits
to fight our souls with hate
our hearts with rage

10.000 dreams for glory rise
now they are awaiting
the hand of fate tonight

So we have gathered here
beyond the endless skies
and we are marching on and on
forver more
for the dark lord - he must fall

Out on the edge of the world
the wasted years are coming to an end
the oceans of evil shall fade
master of doom - we're taking it back again

Deep in our hearts we hear
the call of the wild
spirits of yesterday will fly away

10.000 dreams for glory rise
now they are awaiting
the hand of fate tonight

10.000 dreams for glory rise
now they are awaiting
the hand of fate tonight

Subject: A better Tenderfoot

Tenderfoot By Smudge (or a Lemonheads cover song)
written by Tom Morgan (Smudge) and Adam Young (Daisygrinders)
Tab by Louisa Sher (verve@dot.net.au) and B.Pemberton

The thing that throws you most in this song is the bass part
which plays G F# E pattern on the E string
This can be incorporated into the guitar part nicely
But that confuses the tab a bit, so do that yrself at home...

Where the kids are
and every day
They seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on
And everybody knows
Doors always shut
Windows always closed
The little girl had a burn
The boy was black and blue
They said it came from play
You know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm's broke
Girl's scared to speak
Their parents drink all day
Couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school
And other days they might

Tear tracks on their cheeks

It goes on weeks and weeks

They're only children man!)

In the eyes of society
Where we don't condemn different people

Wipe your feet off before you step in the door
Been banging since '94
You didn't but now you know
Them bitches hitting the floor
Them switches hitting the floor
Them swishes is good to go
And that purple off in your throat, so, yo
You ain't noticed, this how we ride
And we can take this liquor outside

47000,Oblivious To Evil,"Join us

Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of Illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness

Chorus:
Infernal majesty, take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me

Exorcise the powers of death
Invert my cross of time
The realm of Satan anarchy
Inside my sacred sign

Lucifer bring me the legions of death
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Oblivious to evil

(Lead - Eric/Brain)

Death defied the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead

14227,I'm So Miserable,"(Billy Ray Cyrus/Corky Holbrook)

I wake up in the mornin' in a lonely ice-cold bed
Thinkin' 'bout the nightmare that just played in my head
I think of all the things I miss
Like moments that we shared a kiss so dear
I'm so mis'rable without you, it's almost like you're here

I search your house for coffee, but it's to no avail
The day's not even started, it seems it's shot to hell
The jeans I'm wearin' look like dirt
As I put on my old wrinkled shirt, it smells like beer
I'm so mis'rable without you, it's almost like you're here

Bridge:
But there was a time when you were mine
& life was such a pretty dream
Then you fell in love with another man
That changed everything
The world I knew changed every day
As I watched it all slip away so clear
I'm so mis'rable without you, it's almost like you're here

(instrumental)

I turn on my radio, they play your favorite song
Did I not do somethin' right? Was there somethin' I done wrong?
As you pulled away, you should've tried
Instead of feelin' foolish pride & fear
I'm so mis'rable without you, it's almost like you're here
I'm so mis'rable without you, it's almost like you're here

going nowhere near here.
Seen it all once
but lost it inside of something been pulled over my heart.
And you think youâ€™ve seen it all
but you wonder where I go.
Iâ€™ve been growing right side of wrong.
Itâ€™s too late.
Youâ€™re too late.
What happens in my question
am I just splat out, splat out of luck?

People wanna act like they are in and out
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile
And tell you what's the word around town
I know you don't wanna hear the truth
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

Remember back in '02
When I was in school and actin' a fool
My soul got saved, my debt had been paid
But still I kept running off on my crew
Sex on my brain, and death in my veins
Had a main thing, we stayed up 'til 2 (Smoke!)
Waking and thinking we naked, my body was loving it
Soul was hating it, man
Time and time after time, our bodies were close
The girl was so fine
Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine
The miracle of life had started inside
Ignored the warning signs
Supressed that truth I felt inside
I was just having fun with this, I'm too young for this
I'm thinking me, myself, and I
Should I sacrifice this life to keep my vanity and live nice?
And she love and trust me so much that whatever I say, she'd probably oblige
But I was too selfish with my time
Scared my dreams were not gonna serve
So I dropped her off at that clinic
That day, a part of us died

I remember back in the day
I was barely in the first grade
Got teeth missing, watching Tom & Jerry
Tryna go outside so I could play
I was told to watch out for strangers
Keep my eyes out for danger
Folks workin' late, I had a babysitter
I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her
I was almost 8, when she came in late
Woke me up with a game to play
Did a few things that's hard to say
Told me to keep that secret safe
How a young boy supposed to deal
I'm tryna act like it ain't real
Had my innocence just stripped from me
I still don't know how to feel
And I'm wondering how to address it
Can't tell my family, too messy
So I just embrace it, it's hard to face it
I'm too ashamed to confess it
So I kept it in and ain't speak
Can't think, it hit me so deep
So into it, I got promiscuous
And only God can help me get free
But I've been forgiven, my Savior risen
I'm out the prison, I know that
I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles
God will control that
Every time we slip and we fall
Gotta get back up and fight on

84423,When Love Comes To Town,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me.
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget.
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town.

I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream.
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword.
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide.

Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him

Dr. Thomas was a man
The Lord must have appointed
To live among us mountain folks
In eastern Tennessee
And he delivered more than half
The babies in those mountains
Among those babies
He delivered me

There was no way to drive along
The roads back in those mountains
But Dr. Thomas got there
Just the same
He often rode on horseback
To get where he was needed
But if he had to walk
He always came

Repeat Chorus

Dr. Thomas was a friend
A neighbor and a doctor
Though he seldom got a dime
For all he'd done
And I remember lots of times
We sent for Dr. Thomas
But I don't recall a time
He didn't come

They say a man is judged
By the deeds he does while livin'
A judgement when he stands
Before the Lord
And I know heaven holds a place
For men like Dr. Thomas
And I know that he'll receive
His just reward

Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the Tv see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life
that's better than yours
No such thing as a life
that's better than yours
No such thing as a life
that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

Doc busting through the door, he between the legs
He see the head, it's my baby boy!

Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's

What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do?

I told you that I love you girl, I'm nothing without you.

I know is hard, It seems we're worked at this so long
Soft and foolish pride that tell us we're not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question.

Chorus
What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think I'd do?

And we can keep this going on
We'll make it work some way
And every step, it make us stronger every day

And if you're thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one quetion.

What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So waht if I was angry, what did you think I'd do?

38074,Wake Up the Mountain,"(M - Kusch, L - Deris)

Some people die
And even never realize
Man's growing blind
Is seeing only with the eyes
We think we're strong
Believe we never could be wrong
But we are fools
Because we're dying by the rules

Though I cannot change the world we're living in
I can always change myself

One more to count in Wake up the mountain
All colour's slowly Turning to gray
All world is darkling Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again

Cash and carees
Built on the countless sums of fears
All goods of life
Begin to vanish behind tears
How do we know
Why did we choose the way we follow
Why do we hurt
Why do we hurt the ones we love

Though I cannot change the world we're living in
I can always change myself

One more to count in Wake up the mountain
All colour's slowly Turning to gray
All world is darkling Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again

We made the rules and we can change them
Break down the orders one by one
We made the laws and we can break them
Break down the mountain, stone by stone by stone...

One more to count in Wake up the mountain
All colour's slowly Turning to gray
All world is darkling Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again",Helloween,Heavy Metal; Rock,1.0,1
12744,Free,"I had it tough when I was just a little kid
It didn't matter what I thought
It didn't matter what I did
I felt the doubt for what I lacked right from the start
It did a number on my head but it could never touch my heart
'Cause I had just enough imagination
Just enough to keep the faith
That somehow I would think of what to do
When I'd get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion
All the angels came around to help me through
Life blows fast changes, wind blows past pages
All I see is I don't need this
High strung tightrope walk, ticking time bomb clock
Scratch my name off, cut these chains

I'm free.. kicking out of that prison
I am free.. singing those words of wisdom
Let it be.. nobodys gonna put the blues inside of me

And in the stress to be the best I've done it all
I've slammed the doors, I've jammed the locks
I've laid the bricks, I've built the walls
Nobone could tell me back then why joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery locked up deep down inside of me
Took that rage and I, turned that page and I
Packed my tools, went back to school
And I passed my graduation, and I hold my PH.D
In crash test blues I paid those dues

Hanging around with chicks like you
But I do like you
And another one: you say 'like' too much

But I'm shakin at your touch
I like you way too much
My baby I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down, with you

Holy moly baby wouldn't you know it
Just as I was bustin' loose
I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat, and old with you
'cause I'm a burning candle
You're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
And I do like you you're the lucky one
No I'm the lucky one

And tried to play a tune
I can't believe how bad I suck it's true
What could you possibly see in, little ol' 3-chord me?
But I do like you and you like me too
I'm ready let's do it baby

All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

[Snoop Dogg]
Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

79449,Well Traveled,"I don't know where this journey will end
Cause the world keeps calling me
At home people embrace me as a friend
And I'm loving all the energy

I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
And I'm so well traveled
The only place in my life that I'll miss
It's on my bucket list
It's a place I don't know

In every race
Every place that I've ever been
There is so much beauty
Down every highway's the by-way to exit again
So much love I never wanna leave

I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
Cause I'm so well traveled
Wherever life takes me I'm willing to go
Whatever it takes from me
I'ma let it all go

I think it's time to go
Cause I'm so well traveled
Never stay too long
Cause I'm so well traveled

Trippin' round the world
Destination unknown
Gotta keep movin'
Until I'm gone
To find the place
I never wanna arrive
Cause if I ever reach there
There's no place left to go",Janet Jackson,Pop; R&B,1.0,4

You want the power, you need the glory.

Do you see me, could you meet me ?

But now I see you run for cover.

17721,Walk Through the Bottomland,"A New Jersey lady I knew long ago
And she was a lady I say
But she met a cowboy who rode on the rodeo
And he stole her heart straight away

The New Jersey lady she loved him so true
Another love she never had
But cowboys are lonesome and cowboys are blue
And they make the ladies so sad

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

The New Jersey lady knew he loved her too
And you know she tried to hold on
But the rodeo life was the life that he knew
He had to keep drifting along

She never married and she never would
And all of the people they'd say
The New Jersey lady she just ain't no good
To follow a cowboy that way

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

The lady she'd sing him to sleep in the night
And then in the morning he'd go
She loved the darkness and hated the light
Along with that damn rodeo

The New Jersey lady the day that he died
She covered him over with clay
And feeling the wind in the night as she cried
She heard the old cowboy say

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

You leave a trail of tears wherever you go.
One of us will hold you, the other one won't.
But I could never share your love or leave it behind.
Break his heart, not mine.

Do you remember tender moments we shared?
How could this true affection vanish into thin air?
He's not worth the trouble, baby; he's just a waste of your time.
Oh, break his heart, not mine.

Don't you walk away,
You know you're gonna miss me.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
You're gonna miss me,
You're gonna miss my love.

So don't you walk away,
Don't you walk away, walk away.
Don't you walk away, walk away.

So I'll be waiting in the backroom, baby, when you kiss him goodbye.
Oh, break his heart not mine, but...

Don't you walk away, walk away.
Oh don't you walk away.

He was a threat to Ella's greed
See the heathens rise and fight for honor
Tyr will guide us into rightful victory

Take the Saxons, make them beg and plead for mercy
For they will come to cleanse our sins
From the shores we see the Saxon army
See the raven fly, it's Odin by our side

Seeking revenge the Heathen Army
They'll bring the empire to its knees
The pagans strike, the Saxons fall
Show no mercy, make them crawl

One thousand heathens breach the gates
Pray to your god you'll meet your faith
Your kingdom's falling one by one
We take control, nowhere to run

Fourteen years Ironside and Brethren battled
Their blades are stained with nobles blood
From the hoard we hear destiny calling
Marching to the gates we see Valhalla

Seeking revenge the Heathen Army
They'll bring the empire to its knees

Raiders cap back, all black gloves

Ah, but I'm singing like a bird about it now

The bites hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

I had no idea on what ground I was found in
All of that goodness is going with you now
There, when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Driving alone, following your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth
And I was transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me, love, when I'm reborn

Riding in thunder, driving in rain
Sometimes I wonder if my life is in vain
Living in dungeons, rotting in cells
If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was hell

41623,Black Damask,"Now what have I become?
It's more black in my heart
Than the ice in your lungs

Hail elegance as we revel in the lust of pure destruction
""Miss cadaverous"", let me light the dark in your eyes

I am yours
Like the stillness of a corpse
With a heart bound by ache
Though it doesn't beat it breaks

I am cursed
I sew my eyes shut just to sleep
We're caught in all the webs we weave
No sonnet for the recently deceased
They lie awake just to hear you scream

Strip the world and paint it fucking black
Now what have you become?
You once felt like home
Now you're just a ghost in the fog

The funeral song of misery was played on keys of ivory
""Miss cadaverous"", show me who you really are
In my eyes I am yours
Such a paleness I adore

With a heart that's bound by pain
Though it doesn't beat it breaks
I am cursed
Oh what a mess I have made of my life

""His arms are around me
His tongue in my eyes""
Hide my face from the light
""The spider man is having me for dinner tonight""

Now go back to the start, I still hear her voice
But she's lost in the fog
Your ""love"" is just a frail disguise
To hide the pain behind your eyes
In lacerated lullabies

We all fall down

The antidote of your demise
In lacerated lullabies
We all fall down",Motionless In White,Heavy Metal,0.0,1

What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never got the chance to tell the world what I gotta say?
When I’ll die all I do is just ride away
I tried to talk about my life in every song
So you have a little something to remember when I’m gone.
I tell you like this, I ain’t pretending in the…
But I tell you that I’m working and I’m getting very strong
It won’t b long ’till you hear me on the radio
But in my head I got ways to go
But I’mma take it slow, this is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can …
I’m taking notes, I am hip hop
It replaces my soul if I sing to the bottom and make a flow.
I heard the real world’s cold, I’mma take your coat

My friends forgot me cause they probably seen me on…
In an… where I should be out at a party!
It drives me crazy, money is the due
Insomnia I could wait.. something I can do to put the work in it…
Failure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name
Burning up my pain, but I’m working through my pain
Cause life’s hard, ’till you learn it’s just a game!
Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board
If you’re small, put your heart into your rapping more
No money? why the f-ck you’re counting for?

Balls faster than roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me

While you was with the roc on the stage

So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I've seen the madness
Of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces
Regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased...

And if blood is thicker than water
Then what are we fighting for
We’re all sons and daughters
Of something that means so much more

I see it on my TV but I can’t understand
Lord, it’s one big contradiction to me
How in god’s name we love thy neighbor with fists
In our hands
And kill each other when we just don’t agree

Lyrics: Klaus Meine

Another rainy morning
People rushing by
My head is still in the clouds
I dream with open eyes
Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life
Like we know each other
For quite a while

In the sound of silence
Time is standing still
There's some kind of bond between us
That's givin' me the chill
Do you really wonder
That we can burn the sky
It's written a thousand years ago
In the book of life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's always in my dreams
The one who keeps me goin'
When I can't go on
The one that I've been waiting for
For so long

Oh, yeah

Suddenly out of nowhere
She came into my life

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's always in my dreams

Are you the one that God had made for me
Are you the one who's mine eternally
The one who keeps me dreamin'
When I'm sad and tired
Who gives my life a meaning
Till the day I die

Are you the one",Scorpions,Rock; Hard Rock; Heavy Metal,41.5,5

109005,Hopeless Romantics,"You can love most of the people
Most of the time
Now and again if you're lookin' I'm sure
You will find
Someone who's helplessly hoping
That someday
They'll finally find the one
Hopeless romantics keep hoping that
Someday will come
Used to be you could be sure that a
Warrior was true
Nowadays everyone knows that it's cool to be blue
Constantly circling close to the flame And then stopping on a dime
Hopeless romantics will go down in flames every time
Hopeless romantics drop everything and run
When they find a broken heart
Always afraid that they're missing someone
With time on their hands and a missing part
So one of these nights when you're
Sitting at home all alone
And you've finally admitted you're lonely
Right down to the bone
You might as well get on out in it
'Cause you've got everything to lose
And hopeless romantics are always
At home with the blues
And a broken heart
Find the missing part
Hopeless romantics are usually
Hopelessly true

You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast or be the backlash
Of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up

Nothing's gonna hurt you
The way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside

Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing
Bowed down to the mighty
Don't run
Stop holding your tongue

Maybe there's a way out
Of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days
You can let the light in
Show me
How big your brave is

Say, what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I want to see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I want to see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say, what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly
I want to see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

Touch'em a lady (?)

I stick the pits on ya

The drug movers
Girl barracuda
Set you up for the kill
Where you're really not ballin unless you got 10 mill
I shine so bright I blind ya
Cross my crew, we'll find ya
It's a motherfuckin shame
My dominance to this game
I live for gun smoke aroma
Mack yo' bitch into a coma
Two hoes like Noah of every type
Bitches I kick to curbs, you would make your wife
Twice hit by the gun spit, kid still breathing
While half you busters in this damn game are still teething
Believe it if you say it enough that you'll be it
You never lived none of your raps, or even seen it
I mean it, every word a brother say
Everyday a brother play, kid
I politic and parley
The fact is I practice
Camoflauge to this
R & B androgynous
Get the most play
So I get fly
Do a movie - quadruple my cash
You just went double platinum
Let's see if you last
Every word that I say is documented and repeated
The truth is, I dropped the raw game, boy believe it
I've succeeded, in turning dirty dough legal
Bounced to the Bentley from the prime-it-up Regal
Like Biggie says, It's unbelieveable
My street pull
You even play like step in my way
You'll meet my people

[Chorus]

I've been round the world ballin, did it all, what's next?
While most of y'all busters on your first rolex
Been deep in the life kid, since 76
Touched the water, the crack game, the jewelry licks
Fix yourself if you're broke fool, that ain't my fault
The game must be taught and comprehended, then implemented
Moves done illegally, carried out strategically
Or else incarceration is felt, the hand is dealt
You lose it's frightening
Hit with 10 indictments
Kiss your baby and your wife
You're riding kites for life
Alot of y'all won't feel me, but some of y'all do
I'll move at least a half a mill of this before I'm through
That ain't the most, but I've done this longer than you
Plus it ain't my only gig, I'm still connected
With the boys that can flip a thou to a ticket
Wicked
My stature when you're in my rapture
Meet me on the street? I'm the nicest brother you meet
Confusing sometimes, the way I bust a rough rhyme
You might think I'm lying, cool I like that
I smile in your face, squeeze off the case, rock the glock back
In your stomach, then I'll smile again
Don't want to be your enemy, I'd rather be your friend
Only the real win in the game, but what's the prize?
Every man goes through mad drama, and every man dies
Look in my eyes, touch my soul, I ain't like you
The evil I've done, I've got lots of retribution to do
That's an impossible task, 'cause every night the gats blast
So I look to the sky and ask
I've been blessed by God to rock this mic hard, so I do it
You got a problem, work through it
I love New York night, bright lights and action
I love bailin with my Bronx niggas, party crashin
I love switch hittin with my niggas on the shaw
You might see me in New Orleans at Mardi Gras
Or Miami at the Lex, in the Oaktown live
Or in Chi-town at the Players Ball, true P.I.

America welcome to the land of the slaves
where to do anything for money the consequences is the cage
follow the path of a dummy hop a fence into their grave
you can either live to regret or benefit from your ways
the enemies get what they deserve the innocent get the strays
everything aint all gravy baby niggas are subject to change
and it gotta be the paper cause niggas is acting strange
I wake up to (momma missing? ) head throbbing heart full of rage
Urine dirty from haze as strong as thirty grenades
when it comes to ammunition its thirty thirties and K's
and them treys hold me down like that du-rag that's on your waves
America welcome to the land where they kill
America welcome to the land where they steal
where niggas will call your bluff till you let them know shit is real
where material shit will make bitches head over heals
where drama appeals to most of the kids so they watch
where they shoot at cops and most little niggas don't know they pops
where peer pressure comes on you smoke weed get bent to be cool
where the girls loose there virginity in elementary school
where the ambulances are late club floors get left with stains
over step on sneakers and ""nigga what set you claim""
where niggas are ghetto fabulous billings and nice whips
where cops will fuck you up with flash lights and night sticks
America welcome to the land where they frame you
America welcome to the land where they hang you
where it doesn't pay to live with out sin or be an angel
and a regular day of just chillen a bullet can rearrange you
where niggas will back stab you the first time they get the chance to
the envious ways of a coward will do nothing but amp you
I'm from South Side Jamaica where comics and stars are born
where you can wake up in the morning and your brand new car is gone
where niggas that you grew up with is speeding and smoking crack
play Russian roulette with their dreams and there is no way to get them back
where the hood rats will surround you, the constant trade on the stack
its kind of hard to keep your cool when there is constant hate on your back

New York City that's where I stay
where everyday is foul play
we got ours so you should have yours
cause it'll be no warnings when its time to go to war
New York City that's where I'm from
I got my vest, I got my gun
And you should run if you aint got one
cause it'll be no warnings for them niggas, wars come

I got Timberwolves in Minnesota
and got them New York Knicks up in that baking soda, homie
I cross over with rugers in Vancouver when its Grizzly
And I'll Portland Trail blaze ya if ya ass don't hit me
You'll get shot in your Cavs in Cleveland and start bleeding
And now you're on the bench and can't ball all season
Yo I'm rolling Phillies up with the 76's
and got my Heat in Miami on the beach with my niggas
And them hoes from Atlanta is Hawkin' cause they see them
Denver Nuggets on my neck while my ass is walking
Stash the burner, Now I'm in Phoenix Sun

I'm in the truck counting up Milwaukee Bucks
And I, stay with the ratchet cause that's what's up
I got a Wizard in DC that chef up O's
So I'm living like a King in Sacramento
When I'm out in Chicago I'm on some Bullshit
You know semi automatics I stay with a full clip
For them Houston Rockets
baby nine in my pocket
Hypnotic and bomb chronic
lounging with the Sonics
I'm that nigga that will Los Angeles Clip ya
slow your Pace in Indiana while you counting them figures
You I'm out in New Orleans ""wodie"" ducking them warrants
You'll get stung by my mac like a batch of Hornets
Times up like the San Antonio Spurs
I got rings like a Laker but move Celtic birds
Disappear like Magic- Dallas Mavericks with the gat
I'll Detroit piss on you while your lying on your back
Strip shorty out her bra you know I get ass
Cause the kid big ballin' like the Utah Jazz
Toronto Raptor style Ya is a vet
I move like a Net so Cut that check",Lloyd Banks,Rap; Hip Hop,0.0,2
35811,Over The Wire,"Behind all the rusting cranes, in the lengthening shadows of the Empire days
there's a world that waits, but it's not needed.
In the teeming rows behind the goal - yelling for blood on the pitch below;
where does all the passion go when it's not needed?
Over the wire, and into the darkness . .
Come evangelists of the Grand New Age proclaiming the future that they stole,
condemning the things they can't control - just like the priests before;
and now I can hear them call - the ghosts of the 1914-18 war
Where do all the innocents go when they're not needed?
Over the wire and into the darkness . .

And the dawn it will come like blood across the sky,
Not the way that you think, not the way that you dream
In the silence of God, in the fullness of time,
like blood across the sky - the dawn it will come - the dawn it will come.

All still, like the pitshafts and the two-mile-down where they buried their hearts;
where does all the loyalty go when it's not needed?
In the plastic seats behind the goal yelling for blood on the pitch below;
where does all the passion go when it's not needed?

97169,It's Like That,"[Dave]
It's like, New York without a New York yanks
Better yet, New York without the New York franks
It's like hot summers without no A.C
Or never hitting numbers when you go to A.C
It's like six years of your life, go ask Rob
I'm like ""Yo how is it?"" he like ""It's like hard""
Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man
You wanna keep it clean but you can't
Why it gotta be, like, that
And what the life, see life is like a J shot
Shooters son, they got
One point one second, you half court
I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half court
Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper
Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop
Imagine if it didn't exist
Imagine nothing shining your wrist
See, imagining to you is a risk
But think about it, like no chrome rims
And tims would be construction boots (ill)
We probably wouldn't even substitute (ill)
For words we use defining our likes
I'm coal mining these mics
To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget
Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it
But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack
Why it gotta be like that?

That, dadadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dat
Dat, dadadat, dadat, dat, dadadat, dadadat, dat, dat, dadat, dadat

[Refrão: Carl Thomas]
Just running, running, fast as I can
I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man
If I, can't stand the life that I'm in
I gotta keep running ‘cause I'm still gon' win
Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that)
Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that)

[Posdonus]
It's like, Slick Rick without the eye patch
More like, saying slick shit you won't catch
It's like bed time without your PJ's
Or no fed timing in out the PJ's
It's like, one minute you got it, then you broke
Like what I do with it? I copped a few with it
Looking like a problem, but you won't get it solved
You working but you won't get the job
It's like, who would of thought (thought)
It you would of bought (bought)
Into my religion you'd be more like God
But you were steady swimming so you more like cod
See these fools is fish scale, converting to ish male
See I see it like, A alike, B alike
I was taught, if you play alike, be alike
How they don't see it for one to go pop
And this is how you treat Hip-hop?
Imagine if you didn't have that phantom chrome sitting on a curb nigga
The word nigga wouldn't be a bit disturbing nigga
See them roots are like begging for the rain
You entering my kingdom just a begging for the reign
Putting shit stain to paper
Ink pain feeling like fifty-five licks on a slave niggaz back
And not a one of y'all stopping to hate
But why it gotta be like that?

Saying who you want to be
Vision gets dimmer
The room is closing in on me
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm feeling far away, no space, no time
Looking at life through a blue bird's eye
(I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying)
And I went up so far, I took my time
Tell me why I couldn't ever find cloud nine
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)

I spread my wings
The song they sing
I owe it all to you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I owe it all to you, ooh-ooh

It's just smoke and mirrors
They said it's gonna take some time
I think we live in a labyrinth
That was created by my mind
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I never wanted to just suffer inside
Hurt don't heal when I'm always tryna hide
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
And I'm looking at pain like my old close friend
Open arms for her when I see her again
(That's right, that's right, alright, alright)

I spread my wings
The song they sing
I owe it all to you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

80687,Upset With Me,"Maybe someday
You'd take the chance to listen to me
And then you'd know
That I still love you
I'm sorry for the way
We might have behaved
It leaves you up and down
I fell to the ground
Had to escape

I know you're upset with me
But you can't keep hurting me

If you disagree
With every word I speak
I told you what I feel
You say it's not real
So I'm leaving

I know you're upset with me
But you can't keep hurting me

If I'm not enough
To show you who I am
After all I've done
Then it's too tough
For you to understand
I'm taking back what's mine
We both sacrificed
Gave everything we had
But I don't have
To give you my light

I know you're upset with me
But you can't keep hurting me

I'm sorry if I've done anything
That makes you feel that I hurt you
I'm not sure what I'm running to
For now it's something I needed to do
I need to keep me safe from you
You still can't see
Why can't you see?

Painted eyes reaching for the sky
As we reach the moon
Busting clouds, oh, you scream so loud
So I hide from you
I never said a word to you
So I hide the truth
What did I do?
What did I do?

Who needs to know

And I don't disagree
No, I don't see the harm
They say: ""you're crazy
Just leave him he'll suffocate you""
But I wanna be in your arms

They say: ""no, don't pick up the phone
Let them think there's nobody home""
But I'm under your spell
'cause when you call my heart
Starts to grow I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

But here in deep inside lives a voice
A voice so quiet
But I can't hear the voice
When your heartbeat's next to mine

I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

When you said ""baby I just want you
To lay me down and we'll fuck the pain away""
'cause skin on skin
I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay

But here in deep inside lives a voice
A voice so quiet
But I can't hear the voice
When your heartbeat's next to mine

10351,Dear John,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when
they said: Run as fast as you can

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by
Your dark twisted games when I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young
You should've known",Taylor Swift,Pop; Romântico; Pop/Rock,72.7,4
1329,Behind The Mask,"All along I had to talk about it
But like a two edged sword
it cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask and you control your world

You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth, but that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms, you're throwing rocks at me

Who do you love?
Is it me with you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya if you can't answer
But you know me

(All is grand, all is bright) All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom

So take off the mask, so I can see your face
